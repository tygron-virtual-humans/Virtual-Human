# Virtual Humans for Serious Games - ContextProject

Tygron is a company that builds serious games for urban planning.
A game usually consist of a scenario (such as planning a new city area) in which several players play different roles (such as major, city planner, environmental agency, etc.) So, these games are meant to be played by a group of people.
Tygron is interested in simulating some of these people with Virtual Humans, so that you can play the serious game also when not every player in the scenario is present. 

This fits well with our reseach on the simulation of cognition and emotion: humans have emotions and play such games strategically, and so should the Virtual Humans do.

In this context project several groups will work together to enable this. This group will work on developing an example game for Tygron that can showcase the Virtual Humans and design the player behavior.
